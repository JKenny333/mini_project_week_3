    Project Overview

    Our project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of life expectancy factors, exploring the relationships between happiness, alcohol consumption, GDP, and life expectancy across different countries. The primary goal is to derive actionable insights that can inform healthcare interventions and guide insurance risk assessment.

    Hypothesis

    In countries around the world, higher life expectancy is positively correlated with higher happiness scores and GDP, and negatively correlated with alcohol consumption. Additionally, there may be a significant correlation between life expectancy and average BMI, indicating the influence of health and lifestyle factors on longevity.

    Business Problem
    In the proposed project, we aim to analyze how life expectancy is influenced by factors such as happiness, alcohol consumption, GDP . This analysis has significant implications for the healthcare and insurance industries. It can guide healthcare providers in developing targeted health interventions and assist insurance companies in refining risk assessment and product development. By understanding the impact of these variables on life expectancy, these industries can enhance their service offerings, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately improve health outcomes.


    Folder Structure and Contents

    The project is organized into several directories, each serving a different purpose in the analysis workflow. Below is an overview of the project directory structure:

    csv_files/: This directory contains all the CSV (Comma Separated Values) files that are used as data sources for the project.
    jupyter_notebooks/: This folder holds the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb). Jupyter Notebooks are used for performing data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
    sql/: Inside this directory, you'll find SQL scripts that are used for creating tables, inserting data, and querying the MySQL database. It may also contain SQL files for creating views and stored procedures.
    tableau/: This folder contains Tableau workbooks (.twb or .twbx files). Tableau is used for creating interactive data visualizations and dashboards.
    archive/: The archive directory is used to store older versions of files or any other files that are not currently in use but are kept for record-keeping or historical reference.
    presentation/: This directory is intended for presentation materials, likely including PowerPoint slides or other documents that summarize the findings and insights from the project.
