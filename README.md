    Project Overview

    Our project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of life expectancy factors, exploring the relationships between happiness, alcohol consumption, GDP, and life expectancy across different countries. The primary goal is to derive actionable insights that can inform healthcare interventions and guide insurance risk assessment.

    Hypothesis

    In countries around the world, higher life expectancy is positively correlated with higher happiness scores and GDP, and negatively correlated with alcohol consumption. Additionally, there may be a significant correlation between life expectancy and average BMI, indicating the influence of health and lifestyle factors on longevity.

    Business Problem
    In the proposed project, we aim to analyze how life expectancy is influenced by factors such as happiness, alcohol consumption, GDP . This analysis has significant implications for the healthcare and insurance industries. It can guide healthcare providers in developing targeted health interventions and assist insurance companies in refining risk assessment and product development. By understanding the impact of these variables on life expectancy, these industries can enhance their service offerings, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately improve health outcomes.
